First-person shooter, real-time strategy hybrid set in a three-dimensional battlefield. Immerse yourself in the role of fleet commander as you watch the battle and enact your strategy from your capital ship. If your defenses yield to the relentless enemy, leave the safety of your bridge to fend them off. When victory is in your grasp, board the enemy capital ship to personally end the exploits of your rival.
